# Bana Mortality -- Data Mining 4502 Final Project

## Team Members:
### Alex Ray, Bryan Brent, Austin Pearman, Nathan Lile

## Description:
### (Abbreviated version of abstract from final paper)

The goal of this project is to investigate mortality data from the CDC using a variety of classification and clustering methods, primarily decision trees. This analysis will primarily be focused on features of the deceased such as age, race, sex, month of death, and education level.

We use decision trees to perform a binary classification to predict whether or not an instance had their manner of death listed as suicide or not as well as whether or not the death was by homicide. This analysis was then expanded to One vs Rest multiclass classification with both decision trees and random forests. We broadly investigate relics of these computational tools in the form of feature importances to better understand the computational techniques as well as gain insight into the data.

Finally, we look into an unsupervised learning analysis using K-means. While this did not provide us with much information or insight, we present potential future avenues of work to further investigate unsupervised learning in the context of mortality data.
